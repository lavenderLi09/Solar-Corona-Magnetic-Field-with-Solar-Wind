# Solar Corona Magnetic Field with Solar Wind (MagWind)
## Purpose

## Methods
### PFSS (Potential Field Source Surface) Model

The Potential-field Source-surface (PFSS) model offers a straightforward way to represent the global coronal magnetic field. 
It assumes that electric currents in the corona have minimal impact on the large-scale field structure, therefore, the over-all magnetic field
can be simplied to a potential field. We compute the PFSS model using spherical harmonics with the lower-boundary data from SDO/HMI synoptic maps.
The code can perform parallel computations on both CPU and GPU.
